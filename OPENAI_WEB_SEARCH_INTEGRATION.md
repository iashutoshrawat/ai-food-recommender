   - Includes caching, error handling, and result optimization
   - Supports international locations (Delhi, Mumbai, London, Paris, etc.)

2. **Advanced Result Parser** (`lib/search-result-parser.ts`)
   - Parses web search results into structured restaurant data
   - Validates data quality and completeness
   - Normalizes inconsistent data formats
   - Filters out invalid or suspicious entries

3. **Smart Query Builder** (`lib/search-query-builder.ts`)
   - Builds optimized search queries for different scenarios
   - Handles cuisine preferences, dietary restrictions, and price ranges
   - Creates fallback queries for better coverage
   - Validates search context for completeness

4. **Restaurant Validator** (`lib/restaurant-validator.ts`)
   - Multi-criteria quality assessment system
   - Validates business logic (ratings, prices, addresses)
   - Detects suspicious patterns and test data
   - Provides quality scores and improvement suggestions

5. **Intelligent Caching** (`lib/search-cache.ts`)
   - LRU cache with TTL expiration
   - Location-based cache key generation
   - Performance monitoring and cache health metrics
   - Automatic cleanup and cache warming capabilities

6. **Error Handling System** (`lib/error-handling.ts`)
   - Comprehensive error classification and recovery
   - User-friendly error messages and suggestions
   - Intelligent fallback strategies
   - Rate limiting and retry logic

7. **Performance Monitor** (`lib/search-status-monitor.ts`)
   - Real-time system health monitoring
   - Performance metrics and analytics
   - Search trend analysis
   - Automated recommendations for optimization

## 🔄 Enhanced Data Flow

### Before (Mock Data):
User Query → Mock Data Generation → AI Analysis → Response

### After (Real Data):
```
User Query 
    ↓
Query Optimization (cuisine, location, preferences)
    ↓
OpenAI Web Search (real restaurants worldwide)
    ↓  
Result Parsing & Validation (quality filtering)
    ↓
AI Enhancement (personalization + real data analysis)
    ↓
Intelligent Caching (performance optimization)
    ↓
Enhanced Response (real restaurants + match reasoning)
```

## 🚀 New Features & Capabilities

### 1. Real Restaurant Discovery
- **Web Search Integration**: Uses OpenAI's web search to find actual restaurants
- **Global Coverage**: Works internationally - Delhi, Mumbai, London, Paris, Tokyo, etc.
- **Quality Validation**: Multi-layer validation ensures high-quality results
- **Fallback System**: Graceful degradation to mock data if web search fails

### 2. Enhanced AI Recommendations
- **Real Data Analysis**: AI now analyzes actual restaurant information
- **Better Personalization**: Matches real restaurant features to user preferences
- **Improved Accuracy**: Restaurant details are based on current, real information
- **Source Transparency**: Users know when data comes from web search vs fallback

### 3. Performance & Reliability
- **Smart Caching**: 30-minute cache TTL with intelligent key generation
- **Error Recovery**: Multiple fallback strategies with user-friendly messages
- **Rate Limiting**: Handles API limits gracefully
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance tracking and health metrics

### 4. International Support
The system now works seamlessly with international locations:
- **India**: Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai
- **Europe**: London, Paris, Rome, Barcelona  
- **Asia**: Tokyo, Seoul, Bangkok, Singapore
- **Americas**: New York, San Francisco, Toronto, Mexico City

## 🔧 Updated API Endpoints

### Restaurant Search (`/api/restaurants/search`)
- Now performs real web searches using OpenAI
- Enhanced error handling with fallback strategies
- Improved caching and performance monitoring
- Quality validation and result filtering

### AI Recommendations (`/api/recommend`)  
- Analyzes real restaurant data for better personalization
- Enhanced prompts for real data vs generated data
- Improved match scoring based on actual restaurant features
- Source attribution (real vs generated recommendations)

## 📊 Configuration Options

Added to `.env.example`:
```env
# Restaurant Search Configuration
OPENAI_WEB_SEARCH_ENABLED=true
SEARCH_CACHE_TTL_MINUTES=30
SEARCH_MAX_RESULTS=8
SEARCH_TIMEOUT_MS=30000
SEARCH_QUALITY_THRESHOLD=60
```

## 🎯 Key Benefits Achieved

### ✅ Real Data Integration
- No more mock restaurants - all results can be real establishments
- Accurate addresses, phone numbers, and operating hours
- Current ratings and review information
- Real specialties and menu information

### ✅ International Scalability  
- Works with any location worldwide
- Proper handling of different address formats
- Currency and price level normalization
- Cultural and regional cuisine recognition

### ✅ Quality & Reliability

- Graceful fallback when web search is unavailable
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Performance monitoring for system health

### ✅ Enhanced User Experience
- More accurate restaurant recommendations
- Better match reasoning based on real features
- Transparency about data sources
- Improved search result relevance

## 🧪 Testing the Implementation

### 1. Basic Search Test
```javascript
// Test real restaurant search in Delhi
query: "Italian restaurants"
location: { city: "New Delhi", country: "India", latitude: 28.6139, longitude: 77.2090 }
```

### 2. International Search Test  
```javascript
// Test international location
query: "sushi restaurants" 
location: { city: "London", country: "United Kingdom", latitude: 51.5074, longitude: -0.1278 }
```

### 3. Dietary Restriction Test
```javascript
// Test dietary filtering
query: "restaurants"
dietaryRestrictions: ["Vegetarian", "Gluten-Free"]
location: { city: "Mumbai", country: "India" }
```

### 4. Error Handling Test
```javascript
// Test fallback when web search fails
// System should gracefully fall back to enhanced mock data
```

## 📈 Performance Monitoring

The system includes comprehensive monitoring:
- **Search Success Rate**: Tracks web search vs fallback usage
- **Response Times**: Monitors API response performance  
- **Cache Efficiency**: Measures cache hit rates
- **Quality Metrics**: Tracks restaurant data quality scores
- **Error Rates**: Monitors different error types and recovery

## 🔍 Quality Assurance

### Data Validation
- Required field validation (name, cuisine, address)
- Business logic validation (ratings, prices, coordinates)
- Suspicious pattern detection (test data, duplicates)
- Location relevance checking

### Quality Scoring
- Completeness: How much data is available
- Accuracy: Data consistency and validity  
- Relevance: Match to user query and preferences
- Freshness: How current the information appears

## 🚀 Next Steps

The core implementation is complete and ready for testing. Consider these enhancements for the future:
